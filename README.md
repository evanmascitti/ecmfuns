<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package is a compilation of R functions I find useful in my
day-to-day work. Here is a list of each function and a brief description
of what it does:

[`hex_extract()`](R/hex_extract.R): pull the average hexidecimal color
code from an image file

[`new_notes()`](R/new_notes.R): creates a template Rmd document for
taking notes on journal papers and books)
